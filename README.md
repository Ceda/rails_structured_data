# Rails structured data

The aim of this project is to provide some basic rails helpers to render structured data inside web-pages.

:warning: This gem is in early development. :warning:

## Basic information

* The main goal right now is to provide meta information inside web-pages for search engines. We are going to use [this page](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/intro-structured-data) as a reference.

* The prefered format is JSON-LD, although for certain features we might use something else (like microdata or RDFa).
